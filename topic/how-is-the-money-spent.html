      <h2><span class="green-highlight">Part Three:</span> How is the money spent?</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Now it is the right time to get an idea how this money is spent. For this we will be looking at the budget that has been announced for the upcoming year.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The biggest section of this budget goes toward the <strong>Treasury Portfolio</strong>. This takes up <strong>29%</strong> of the government budget. This includes things like the <strong>ATO</strong>, which is is around <strong>5%</strong> (of the total budget - all these figures will be in percentages of the total budget unless otherwise stated). A large proportion of this money goes into the <strong>Department of the Treasury</strong>, coming to about <strong>20%</strong>.</p>
      <p>[1]<a class="reference-link" href="http://theopenbudget.org/">http://theopenbudget.org/</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The next biggest section is the Social Services portfolio. This takes up around 28% of the government budget. Social security makes up 24% of the total (86% of this portfolio), with the Aged Pension taking up 10% of the budget, Disability Support 4%, Newstart (unemployment benefits) 2%, and Carer Support 1%. These figures might challenge the common perception that quite a large percentage of our budget is spent on the dole. (Of course, there are surely people who sit on the dole and just wait for money - there&rsquo;s no denying that. But it helps to have these figures to put things in perspective.)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The next biggest section is health, which is 13% of the budget, which is slightly larger than our defence budget (11%), and our education and training budget, 8%. In total these three areas make up 32% of the budget.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The summary looks like this --</p>
      <p>Treasury: 29%</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- ATO: 5%,</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Treasury Department: 20%</p>
      <p>Social Services: 28%</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Social security: 24%</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Aged pension: 10%</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Disability support: 4%</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Newstart: 2%</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Carer support: 1%</p>
      <p>Training and Education, Health, and Defence: 32%</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Health: 13%</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - Defense: 11%</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Education and training: 8%</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>There is also roughly 11% left over, and these slivers are used to fund things like finance (2%), foreign affairs and trade, the Attorney General&rsquo;s portfolio, infrastructure and regional development, agriculture, the arts, and border protection and immigration, none of which come to more than 1%.</p>
