      <h2><span class="green-highlight">Part Two:</span> The International Comparison</h2>

      <p>How does the Australian government&rsquo;s debt and deficit compare to the budgets of countries around the world?&nbsp;As discussed in Part One, Australian government net debt is around $250B, or 17% of GDP. By way of comparison here is the net debt as a percentage of GDP for other countries around the world (as at 2014).</p>
      <p>Greece: 155%</p>
      <p>Japan: 134%</p>
      <p>Belgium: 105%</p>
      <p>Italy: 104%</p>
      <p>US: 88%</p>
      <p>France: 84%</p>
      <p>UK: 83%</p>
      <p>Spain: 71%</p>
      <p>Germany: 57%</p>
      <p>Canada: 37%</p>
      <p>South Korea: 32%</p>
      <p><strong>Australia: 17%</strong></p>
      <p>Denmark: 8%</p>

      <p>While some countries have a net credit.</p>

      <p>Bulgaria: +3%</p>
      <p>Sweden: +18%</p>
      <p>Finland: +50%</p>
      <p>Norway: +166%</p>

      <p>There are only 12 countries out of a possible 200+ who are in credit (although, to be fair, there are many countries with sketchy data, and these don&rsquo;t show up).&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Comparing deficits across the world is more difficult, as these figures change more year to year, whereas a country's debt is less volatile.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>According to recent data, Norway is one of the larger countries running a surplus (6.6%), with Germany at 1%, and most countries in deficit - Canada at 2%, Australia, Finland, and the US 2.5%, Italy and Denmark 3%, France, Spain, and the UK around 4%, and Japan higher at 7%.</p>

      <p>[3]<a class="reference-link" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2222rank.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2222rank.html</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>So it can be seen that Australia&rsquo;s net government debt is quite low relative to the debt burdens of other countries. Our budget deficit is  roughly in the middle range. This is not a partisan assessment. It also says nothing about trends, and is also not something to be taken lightly. The suggestion that there is a 'budget emergency&rsquo; might be harder to square with those figures, but to some degree it&rsquo;s a matter of your perspective. Ideally these figures can help you to form a educated opinion.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>That&rsquo;s not the whole of the story either. Another measure which is of interest (if you are a nerd) is that which shows the proportion GDP taken in revenue by the government. Debts and deficits don&rsquo;t just make themselves. They can be manoeuvred by the government either taking in some more revenue, or spending less. Firstly, let&rsquo;s have a look at how Australia compares regarding the amount of revenue that the government takes in.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The Australian government takes in about 22% of GDP in revenue - which is also known as a country&rsquo;s tax burden. This is what the government has to spend. It is influenced by many factors, including tax rates, how the economy of the country is performing, and many other factors that feed back into these elements. Higher taxing nations will generally have a higher percentage of government revenue as a proportion of GDP, and lower taxing governments a lower burden as a percentage. How does Australia stack up in the comparison?</p>

      <p>Of the 35 countries in the <strong>OECD</strong>, Australia consistently places in the bottom 5 or 6. The OECD boffin&rsquo;s calculations put our tax burden closer to 25% (these things are very hard to calculate, and different organisations give different values - but here we are comparing countries, so they have all been calculated the same way for this comparison), and the average in the low to mid 30s (around 33%). The US and Korea have a slightly lower percentage (by one or two points), but most other countries are ahead of us, with notable countries being: <strong>Japan 28%</strong>, <strong>Canada 30%, Spain 31%, the UK 34%, Germany 36%, France </strong>and <strong>Norway at 42%,</strong> and <strong>Denmark 47%.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>[5]<a class="reference-link" href="http://www.treasury.gov.au/Policy-Topics/Taxation/Pocket-Guide-to-the-Australian-Tax-System/Pocket-Guide-to-the-Australian-Tax-System/Part-1">http://www.treasury.gov.au/Policy-Topics/Taxation/Pocket-Guide-to-the-Australian-Tax-System/Pocket-Guide-to-the-Australian-Tax-System/Part-1</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In light of these calculations, Australia is now not only a country with low levels of debt (and a moderate level of deficit), but it is actually a very low taxing nation. The services that the government provides must come out of that revenue (or the government needs to borrow and increase the debt). If a country wants more or better services, or for a stronger social safety net, then some of the solution could be for the government to take in some more revenue. The issue is complex, no doubt, but having these facts to hand helps to give shape to the issues involved.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Now that we have some idea of the figures involved, maybe it&rsquo;s time to see where this money is being spent.</p>
