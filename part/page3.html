        <h2>Part Three: How is the money spent?</h2>
        <p>Now it’s probably around the right point in time to get a bit of an idea how this money is spent. For this we will be looking at the budget that has been announced for the upcoming year.</p>
        <p>The biggest section of this budget goes toward the Treasury Portfolio. This takes up 29% of the government budget. This includes things like the ATO, which is is around 5% (of the total budget - all these figures will be in percentages of the total budget unless otherwise stated). A large proportion of this money goes into the Department of the Treasury, coming to about 20%.</p>
        <p>The next biggest section is the Social Services portfolio. This takes up around 28% of the government budget. Social security makes up 24% of the total (86% of this portfolio), with the Aged Pension taking up 10% of the budget, Disability Support 4%, Newstart (unemployment benefits) 2%, and Carer Support 1%. These figures might challenge the common perception that quite a large percentage of our budget is spent on the dole. (Of course, there are surely people who sit on the dole and just wait for money - there’s no denying that. But it helps to have these figures to put things in perspective.)</p>
        <p>The next biggest section is health, which is 13% of the budget, which is slightly larger than our defence budget (11%), and our education and training budget, 8%. These last three areas make up 32% of the budget in total.</p>
        <p>The summary looks like this --</p>
        <img src="graphs/pie_chart.png">
        <ul>
          <li><em>Treasury: 29%</em></li>
            <ul>
              <li>ATO: 5%,</li>
              <li>Treasury Department: 20%</li>
            </ul>
          <li><em>Social Services: 28%</em></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Social security: 24%</li>
              <li>Aged pension: 10%</li>
              <li>Disability support: 4%</li>
              <li>Newstart: 2%</li>
              <li>Carer support: 1%</li>
            </ul>
          <li><em>Training and Education, Health, and Defence: 32%</em></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Health: 13%</li>
              <li>Defense: 11%</li>
              <li>Education and training: 8%</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>There is also roughly 11% left over, and these slivers are used to fund things like finance (2%), foreign affairs and trade, the Attorney General’s portfolio, infrastructure and regional development, agriculture, the arts, and border protection and immigration (none of which come to more than 1%).</p>
