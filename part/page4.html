        <h2>Provisional Part 4: What to make of all of this?</h2>
        <p>I am not an economist, nor have I formally studied economics. I don’t bring any particular expertise to these matters. But my view is that, given how much the two parties talk about the budget, spending, and how much various aspects of the government cost, it is useful to at least have some grasp of the figures. I hardly expect people to be able to reel off these numbers off the top of their heads, but having some sense of these values and proportions can help to keep the conversations around these issues in proportion as well.</p>
        <p>It also helps to put things that are taken for granted as being unassailable truths by politicians, by people own the media, and by citizens as they argue these things out. You may read those numbers and still decide that there is a budget emergency, or that Australia is a high taxing nation. You may dislike government and think that they misspend your valuable contributions. Or you may still think that we spend too much on people sitting around at home getting something for nothing. To some extent anyone is welcome to their opinion, and people are of course welcome to interpret these figures any way they like. The point would be to start from a place where there are at least facts to be considered as part of how these conversations take place.</p>
        <p>At some point people need to recognise that if they like government services and want more or better ones that they might need to pay a little more tax, and that the Australian government might need to increase the amount of revenue that it takes in - and that this would only bring us closer to the situation in the majority of Europe, and a little further away from America. Other people may disagree, and that’s up to them. Some people will think that things should be more every man for themselves, and that government should be much smaller. But you cannot have it both ways - numbers can’t bend.</p>
        <p>Would you like to have better hospitals? Better schools? A better safety net? No? Ok that’s fine. But if you do, then the government might need to raise a few more beans, and you might need to pay a bit more in tax. Tax isn’t a dirty word - it’s a necessary one.</p>
