      <h2>Part One: The Australian Government Budget</h2>

      <p>GDP (a country’s gross domestic product) is the total amount of economic activity. This is the grand total of everything that anyone does in Australia involving money [Chopper, Cruz, Swingers, etc] - whether that be feeling some widgets, giving a haircut, or any number of other things (except a few activities that exist off the books).</p>
      <p>In 2015 this totalled $1.62 trillion (the 12th largest in the world). Just to be clear, $1T is one thousand billions. So this could also be seen as around 1,600 billion dollars. (Just so you can get something of a picture of this, one million is one thousand thousands - 1,000,000, a billion is one thousand millions - 1,000,000,000, and one trillion is one thousand billions - 1,000,000,000,000) [Dots on a page, Trump, etc]</p>
      <h2>[Lib Party Debt Statement]</h2>
      <p>The Debt Statement provides information on estimated and projected Government net debt, current and projected debt on issue and details of climate spending and the extent to which this spending has contributed to debt.</p>
      <p>Net debt is expected to be $278.8 billion (16.9 per cent of GDP) in 2015‑16. Net debt is projected to peak at 18.5 per cent of GDP in 2017‑18, before declining over the medium term to 9.6 per cent of GDP ($263 billion) in 2025‑26.</p>
      <p>The total taken in tax revenue during this time comes to around $350 billion. This comprises around 21.6% of GDP. This is the money that the government takes in and then can spend - although at times it doesn’t take in quite enough to pay for the programs that it has on its books (and, on occasion, too much).</p>
      <p>Taxes as a proportion of GDP steadily increased from the early 1990s peaking in 2004-05 at 24.2 per cent. The tax-to-GDP ratio declined as the global financial crisis reduced receipts sharply. Tax receipts are expected to rebound steadily relative to GDP to average 22.8 per cent over the estimates period.</p>
      <h2>Why talk in percentage of GDP?</h2>
      <p>Let’s say you owe $50,000, and you also earn $50,000. That’s not a good situation. There you would owe 100% of what you earn in a year. Clearly you couldn’t pay it off in the next year - you have stuff to buy (like: blah). The situation is obviously a lot worse if you only earn $25k, as you would owe 200% of your wage. On the other hand, if you earn $250,000, then the amount you owe is only 20% of the total that you earn in a year, and so you are probably in a good position to pay that money back promptly (given that you endeavour to buy one or two fewer ivory back scratchers). In fact, you might even be able to borrow more were it necessary. (Obviously, governments don’t have the whole of the GDP at their disposal. They only take a proportion of this to spend.)</p>
      <p>The deficit is the amount that the government falls short on it’s revenue as compared to its spending. This is the year by year value that contributes to the total debt - the value of all the accrued deficits - all of the decisions made in money matters by the Australian government over the years. That net [explanations?] debt is currently around $250 billion, which is equivalent to roughly 17% of GDP (and the gross debt a little over $400 billion, or roughly 25% or a quarter of GDP)</p>
      <p>(Net debt takes into account all the assets that the Australian Government owns, whereas gross debt his the total owed. Gross debt would be the equivalent of not counting the house that you own in the calculations, whereas the net debt acknowledges that you might be in debt, and it might be a lot, but that you own a house, and that house is worth something if it came to be sold. It’s customary in pointy head circles to talk more of the net government debt, as it gives a better sense of Australia’s fiscal situation.)</p>
      <p>The ongoing deficit in the budget (the shortfall) is currently around $40 billion, which is in the realm of 2.5% of GDP.</p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_government_debt#/media/File:Government_debt_gdp.jpg">Wiki for Gov Dept.</a>
      <p>So, in summary, Australia’s GDP is around $1.6T, it’s net debt around 17% of that figure, and it’s current deficit around 2.5% of that figure.</p>
      <p>A lot is made of debt and deficit during the election. Fair enough too - it’s important stuff. But knowing these numbers is vital to being able to understand the situation. Having said that, knowing these numbers is not enough, because they don’t exist in a vacuum. We need to have a look at the global comparisons to get an idea where we stand in an international context.
