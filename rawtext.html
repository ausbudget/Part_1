<p>Much has been made of Australia&rsquo;s budget, and it&rsquo;s debt and deficit. Our politicians talk endlessly about the amount that these concepts matter, and ask us to believe them when they tell us about the state of Australia&rsquo;s finances. That&rsquo;s fine of course, but from my brief surveys of friends and family who are informed, have good jobs, and who have at least a little interest in these matters (or politics more generally), many do not know the figures involved. That&rsquo;s fine - to a point. Not having all the latest stats and graphs in your head is totally understandable. But if these concepts are so important (and how could they not be if the politicians keep referring to these matters), then at least a rough sense of what is going on and what these numbers mean will help people to better understand these issues.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, this cannot be just another budget, because these are extraordinary times. This budget is an economic plan, it's not just another budget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And third, by continuing to ensure the government lives within its means, to balance the budget and reduce the burden of long-term debt. In this budget we will continue to cut unnecessary waste and keep government spending under control to balance the budget over time.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">From Morrison&rsquo;s 2016 budget speech.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get your head around the figures involved means understanding a few concepts. The first is <strong>GDP</strong>, and related to that is the amount of that GDP that the government takes to fund its projects, known as government <strong>revenue</strong>. This revenue is independent from the amount the government wants to spend, and there may be either a <strong>deficit</strong> (when the revenue is less than the amount spent), or a <strong>surplus</strong> (revenue is higher than expenditure). The deficits add to a country&rsquo;s total <strong>debt</strong>, and a surplus could be used to pay down this debt. That&rsquo;s the overview, but to get a better picture of the state of Australia&rsquo;s fiscal situation, we will need to have a bit of a look at the details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GDP</strong> (a country&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product) is the total amount of economic activity. This is the grand total of everything that anyone does in Australia involving money - whether that be selling some widgets, giving a haircut, or any number of other things (except a few activities that exist off the books). Everything that uses money in some way contributes to GDP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015-16 this estimated to be $1.62 trillion (the 12th largest in the world). Just to be clear, $1T is one thousand billions. So this could also be seen as around 1,600 billion dollars. (Just so you can get something of a picture of this, one million is one thousand thousands - 1,000,000, a billion is one thousand millions - 1,000,000,000, and one trillion is one thousand billions - 1,000,000,000,000.)</p>

<p>The total taken in tax <strong>revenue</strong> during this time comes to around $350 billion. This comprises around 22% of GDP. This is the money that the government takes in and then can spend - although at times it doesn&rsquo;t take in quite enough to pay for the programs that it has on its books (and, on occasion, the government can take in too much).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why talk in percentage of GDP?</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you owe $50,000, and you also earn $50,000 per year. That&rsquo;s not a good situation. There you would owe 100% of what you earn in a year. Clearly you couldn&rsquo;t pay it off in the next year - you have stuff to buy (like Netflicks subscriptions, coffee, your mortgage, whathaveyou). The situation is obviously a lot worse if you only earn $25k, as you would owe 200% of your wage. On the other hand, if you earn $250,000, the amount you owe is only 20% of the the amount that you earn in a year, and so you are probably in a good position to pay that money back promptly (given that you endeavour to buy one or two fewer ivory back scratchers or Porches). In fact, you would almost certainly be able to borrow more were it necessary.&nbsp;(Obviously, governments don&rsquo;t have the whole of the GDP at their disposal - they only take a proportion of this to spend.)</p>

<p>The <strong>deficit</strong> is the amount that the government falls short on it&rsquo;s <strong>revenue</strong> as compared to its <strong>spending</strong>. This is the year by year value that contributes to the total <strong>debt</strong> - the value of all the accrued <strong>deficits</strong> (or surpluses) - all of the decisions made in money matters by the Australian government over the years. The current <strong>deficit</strong> is roughly $40B, or&nbsp;<strong>2.5%</strong> of GDP, adding to a net <strong>debt</strong>&nbsp;that is currently around $260 billion, or equivalent to roughly <strong>17%</strong> of GDP (and the gross debt a little over $400 billion, or roughly 25% or a quarter of GDP).</p>

<p>(<strong>Net debt</strong> takes into account all the assets that the Australian Government owns, whereas <strong>gross debt</strong> his the total owed all up. <strong>Gross debt</strong> would be the equivalent of not counting the house that you own in the calculations, whereas the <strong>net debt</strong> acknowledges that you have debt, and it might be a lot, but that you also own a house, and that house is worth something if it came to be sold. It&rsquo;s customary in pointyhead circles to talk more of the <strong>net government debt</strong>, as it gives a better sense of Australia&rsquo;s fiscal situation.)&nbsp;</p>
